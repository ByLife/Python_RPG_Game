# Python RPG Game
A small game made with love with a partner that made the custom maps

All the infos about how to play it is in the game itself

Thanks to https://github.com/Naywvi for the custom maps (made with Tiled) !

Just a game that I made because I had nothing to do for the moment, made it in september 2022.
Only uploading it to my github to share it and for my personal memories ^^
