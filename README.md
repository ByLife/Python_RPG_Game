# Python RPG Game
A small game made with love with a partner that made the custom maps

All the infos about how to play it is in the game itself

Thanks to https://github.com/Naywvi for the custom maps (made with Tiled) !

Just a game that I made because I had nothing to do for the moment, made it in september 2022.
Only uploading it to my github to share it and for my personal memories ^^


```
#How to run it

python main.py

Only need to python the main.py
Need Python Version 3.10.1 and above

If problems are encountered (with the libs), install them and if it doesn't fix them, you can open a ticket

Thanks !
```
